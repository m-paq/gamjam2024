evil cat:
Gumbolz, the evil cat, has always been a pain to the master ever since he got a hot and sexy girlfriend. He is probably jealous of her because there is no more playtime for Gumbolz. Recently, he has become really violent towards her. I have a feeling something bad is going to happen.

dead woman:
Tragedy struck last night. The master's loved one has been killed by Gumbolz, I saw him stab her repeatedly all over the body. It was brutal. The master was in such despair when he discovered the mutilated body in the kitchen.

interrogation:
The police was quick to arrive to the scene. He was obviously the prime suspect since no one would ever think the cute little cat could ever do such a horrible thing. The police took him in, and I have a bad feeling he will be convicted.

rat detective:
I believe it is up to me, Coinkydink, to step up to the task and become a detective to help my master prove his innocence, and maybe get revenge for his loss.

cd:
This dvd has claw marks all over from all the times Gumbolz wanted the master to watch it.

knife:
The knife is full of fur. He was too careless to clean up his mess.

tuna:
This poison is a classic cat move to try to poison a human. Who wouldn't believe a cat could order poison on Amazon.

frame:
The frame has claw marks all over the master's girlfriend. This cat cannot handle his emotions.
